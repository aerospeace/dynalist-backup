				Tasker ideas:
					Turn On Auto-Rotate When You Open Some Apps (ex: youtube)
						Create a new profile and select an application.
						Choose an application that when being opened the Auto-Rotation should be turned on.
						Create a new task and tap the “+” icon.
						Tap on "Display."
						Set “Display Auto-rotate” to ON.
					Turn On Wi-Fi At Home
						Go to your GPS and turn it on.
						Go to the place in your home where your Wi-Fi router is located.
						Now open Tasker and navigate to "Profile" and choose "Wi-Fi at home."
						Head to "Location" and do your Net on and your GPS off. Also, set the radius as 500m and get Fix.
						Now create a new task & click on the "+" icon.
						Go to the net and then click on "Wi-Fi" and turn it on.
						Create another task and click on "+" icon and name it "Leaving Home." Now in this section, you need to turn off your Wi-Fi. So go to "Net" and then search for Wi-Fi and turn it off.
