			Day One
				Welcome your new colleague! Reach out to them and ensure they have their laptop with required software and requested accessories. Confirm that they are able to log in to the network and can set up remote access.
				If the new hire will be reporting to an office, confirm who will be greeting them and explaining office protocol.
				Discuss the 90-day plan with your new colleague.
				Remind them to review [onboarding activities for new colleagues](https://willistowerswatson.service-now.com/servicecentral?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0014295).
				Facilitate introductions to the team, peers and their onboarding buddy.
				Clarify expectations by reviewing role and responsibilities, work/client assignments, internal support structure and key business processes and procedures as well as ways of working. Convey your communication preferences, including how best to contact you.
				Teams and phone number
				Keycard and code and locker and office services
				Oracle
				Objective
				Linkedin profile to create if needed post new job and embrace WTW color scheme (from brand central)?
				How to make search from home page, reorganise tiles (do it based on mine)

Presentation on 2023-05-30: OVT
	Start by sick last week, and tehcnially day off yesterday
	OVT
		Selector at top
		UL vs VFA vs PVFCF
			Actual OP vs expected EOP vs actual EOP: PVCF = UI - VF + leakage
				Leakage = 100,000 SEK = 0.2% of VF
			Split of expected item impacting allocation of rows for each VFA, UI and PVCF: not sure why , but results ok
			Can see not difference expected actuals
			One issue regarding inv return, see column P and check in CG31
		B68 and B71 not applicable:
			Typical UK, transfer to other group of contract:
				typically from non participating to participating, as if participating contract own UL together with Shareholder
				Hence could claim a share of of non participating movement
		LRC
			Reminder LRC = PVFCF (already covered) + CSM (-LC if present) + RA
				No RA for now
				For same reasons decided to split Movement in CSM/ LC and CSM LC itselfs
			Analyse by row
				CSM starting point input from transition, made up number
				EXpected income = Roll FWD of CSM
				Transfer of CSM calcl so Mvst CSM actual = 0 and copied to CSM column
				Amortisation of CSM is release of CSM, i.e. decrease and increase in insurance renuve
			LC not sure about why appear and disapper
		LIC
			**Not understood why exists**
			Got a call with Rob but only show big line, need to go in the engine
			Try to get a call with David as experience
			Check with Scildon and / or CA whether presented on epxected basis and if yes rationale for that
			Alrady can see but need eexplantion:
				" Expected incurred claims" balances UI and PVFCF (instead of using VF)?
				" Expected incurred expenses" balances UI and PVFCF (but with both PVFCF = UI = 0, so = PVFCF)
			Do not know whyLIC: Investment Component (Includes New LIC IC) = Expected incurred claims (UI)
			CLaims paid not totally right as include also expenses
		Actuals:
			Not clear why appear between actual at BOP and Expected at EOP and not in Expected EOP and Actual EOP
		Other
			Maybe would be more appropriate ot ensure tax consistency instead of putting them in inv expenses:
				pl_policyholder_tax_payable = aoc_expected_fiduciary_tax_average
What to discuss during meeting
	Original Check ss
		Variable mapping essentially good, already knew that due to check
	Objective was to be able to run the engine with
		No variance
			Current = LRP but changing t=12 becomes t=0, and use the cashflow from there
		No NB
		At the moment assuming no CF after YE2022 (i.e. Current file), but values at t=0
			Not sure will not create an issue due to PV values at t=0, maybe need the full extract from PHILIP
	Step 1 was to compare fields filled in by Scildon and CAA with non 0 for the VFA cashflow files.
		See end for details
		Note that I have done it only for Current
		Already notice that many fields not filled in for other files for CA
		Might expect NB to have some fields populated (initial exp for instance)
		Will at some points compare fields populated between all CF files
	Step 2: Structure for keeping track of CF and Assumption submission:
		Created a script to automatically copy CF files as many are the same for now
			Current = TrueUp = AoC_All_Non_Economic_Assumptions_Unlocked
			LRP = Actuals
			New_Business = AoC_Restated_{1,2,3} = Unlocking_{1,2} = 0
			Create tab to bring in the cashflows from Philip, will need to be industrialised
		Keep track of each assumption file and modifications as well areas of uncertainty
		Keep track of each zip submitted, although retrieval through of Unify possible
	Step 3: Engine run
		Validation at the beginning of the CF file
			Allowed me to identified a new check required that will fail
				reg the reconciliation of PVFP with PV components,
				will discuss with Philip, but should be easy fix in < 1 hours incl testing
				Running with artificial amendemnet at the moment in field pv_income_total_vfa_im
			Remaining failing checck even after adhoc
		Validation at output stage
			Failing on a check
			Present ss
			8nvestigatomf, maybe AoC file, maybe just AoC wrong and maybe cashloe
	Work in progress:
		AoC_Investment_Variance_VFA is 0 as well, Wrong
		Discount curves to use and meaning.
			For isntance one type of discount curve not used by engine as VFA indirect
			But on the other since CoC pretty sure some Discount curves sued for calculation of RA
			Trying to figure out
		Getting run through the engine without failover
			Will try change of CF file (length of projection
			No filling with 0 AoC_Investment_Variance_VFA.csv
		Look at actual results
	For later
		NB and required amendments to model
		Other steps of the AoC
	Waiting process or other people or different work stream:
		CF files and assumptions
			RA
			csm_im and lc_im i.e.:
				transition
				NB (double check whether calculation through the engine vs externally are options, and decide which one if it is the case)
			lic
			Cohort structure
			fiduciary_tax_im (solved in terms of CF, but might need to revisit)

Meeting with KLP reg Unify
	Completing environment setup for IFRS 17:
		One prod in use
			Status update from KLP
				Automated solution now; except:
				Snowflake integration. Planned on dropfile at the moment
			They are happy with the current setup.
		Second env needs to be setup
			Plan in place? View on how can we support?
				IT person was not in the room.
			However interested in knowing about timeline:
				Lewis Q: when you want to start, what support you would need.
		Implement cheatsheet:
			Accounting procedures
			SII
	Expanded use case:
		Gry idea: pension administration:
			Lewis Question: How can we support them?
Thomas meeting
	Summary Skandia
		Unify goes now all the way to the ledger
		Swedbank next week. Such a long time impl remember only the good
		Snowflake not dashboard
		Simplification all SII, no IM ambition, not IORP / traffic light
		Lot of questions around unify Vs DevOps
			DevOps contain truth model Dev
			Awkward to have to publish something to be able to run it (no branching)
			Wish management of workflow in DevOps
			Wish integration of SQL code in Unify.
				Mention DV but not enthusiastic about it
				Thinking about python but also not that interesting
		Lots of failover of Unify due to SISS, working on it hoping that Python would solve it
		No comment RAFM
		No time for extended usage discussion
		VGrid
			Calc cost vGrid all Vs HPC
				However in the end cannot leave HPC as otherwise outsourcing
			And if keep park might as well use it
		Some workflows toV
			Auto yes
			Testing of model release
		Busy with Lumina and Snowflake
		Unify SaaS after 3.1. a bit of interest in python activities
			Foresaw ideal and want iIT on their side following 5i.e consuming migration as not a standard system
			However data privacy issue got more formalised and harder since vGrid
		Inca (Lumina) last migrant
	Thomas meeting prep
		Swedbank approaching them and deedback
		Satisfaction:
			RAFM
			vGrid
			Unify and Unify 3.x: good feedback used by dev team
		Unify specific:
			Live dashboard for instance live result of solvency position following assumption changes

				Due to mass lapse reinsurance arrangement
				Not sure affecting them
			Movement in IFRS 17 space: comparability
			Modeeling: Still ahead of other mutuals (LF, Skandia)
			Shock reg. Skandia out of ITP
			Other:
				SaaS to reduce IT risk, operational, automatic upgrade, accessible from anywhere, auto scalable.
					Phase 1 RAFM vgridd so compatible
						Number of env

						In/out metrics
						Incl disaster recovery, scalability (alert if go above), end to end security
						Clear siloing
						Azure fileshare
						Network policies internal containers and public interface
						Automated failover pipelines (10-15mn)
					Upgrade
						A lot of them without update incl unify version, with obj a more saas freq (more than 6 months)
						Exception: sql: agreed downtime
						Breaking change: agreed when if want, prod va dev
					Easier support on all aspects of authorisation given (not sure), cpu usage, port etc
				HPC vs vGrid cost?
	LF mee5ing
		LF prep
			Get:
				Folksam
					People to contact
					Priorities when left, what worked on

LF UL Mass lapse
	LF pre meetingg ideas
		Me compare models
		See whether assumption available
	Meeting on 20230406
		Privately
			Companies:
				LF: Z:\2023\LF - 01\UL31
					Swedbank
					Movestic
					Nordnet
					Skandia (excl assumptions)
				Not sure:
					Folksam (x2)
					Can look at other markets close by (Norway and Batlcis) but not sure relevant
				Mattew edwards not sepcifc, incl:
					mail from 14/01/2021: best practice reg: freq review, internal ressource vs externalm
					Worth looking at: impact of recession
		Aspect meetingsuggestoin:
			Intel gathering
				
			Private intel
				Calculation
					At least 5 UL company we can compare method of calculation, maybe 6, but would be anonymised results
					Assumptions for 4 companies for sure, maybe 5
						Two might be out-of-date
						Does not include assumptionderivation
				Can try to get intell of a company recently going through similar exercise
			Compilation of public information available (EV report, etc)
			Other colleagues
			We have been involved in investigationi

Ideas of topic from lewis :
	Solvency ratio
	Pension: Alba/Joakim: inflation for Swedish client:
		Alecta
		Alecta indexation base belops: 10.9%, applied to pension being paid, left what over to active member
		Future inflation not needed for 1.75% moved to 2%
Notes to save Line management
	Project she did:
		Training trip to Norway to help Seb with ResQ training
		IFRS 17 PowerBI with Seb and Maggi (the one for training) before Xmas for Saudi client
	Feedbacks from Bahra Govinder
		Build accurately
		Work spec good, but will come progressively:
			Excel Knowledge
			Insurance markets (what are they trying to achieve)
		Regarding hours: not keen on too much work, but not slacking off compared to rest of team
		Current Project
			Radar - AXA UK
			5 people (incl him) + lead
		Development required: log keeping for herself when presenting, example:
			Said small development at the beginning, but ahd to change lookup
			5 fields updated only 1 shocase, all others are supposed to be similar but in fact were not
		Ask client exposure
		Idea:
			Excel training?
			Asked for client exposure (note taking for instance)
ESG notes
	Questions
		Physical risk vs
		Liability risk
	Regulator:
		Financial disclosure
		Scenarios testing capital
	Companies
		Investment obviously
	Geography
		America
			Behind peak up over the last 12 months
		EMEA
			P&C
				Product: photovoltaic, no risk partner
				Exclusion of industry: oil gas
				0 target for large insurer
				Sustainable report from sustainability function
				Sustainability function and underwriting / risk mgt function not linked
				Not sure how to support transitioning
				Governance not big issue because already a lot of reg
				Working into EU taxonomy: sustainable Vs non sustainable: reporting requirement
				Actuarial function have to include esg into their work, on the liability and investment
				Far away from esg bay, risk mgt, social consideration
					Thinking of how social in justice incl / Excel in bias in pricing algorithm
					Gender pay gap included in underwriting ina company: exceptional
			Carbon neutral: more focused on carbon, options to invest a lot of green
			Net zero: green house gas, methane include; 5% only can be through investment in a tree
		Scope 3: who insure (underwrite), where we invest: lion share of insurers
		Next sessions
			Scenarios
			Targets category (emission)
			PC: transition commercial
			Data metrics (incl own hub)
			Climate models and link to cat mode (pc reprice annually however need to ensure cat model compatible with climate model)

Notes OP presentation
	Not a big fan of:
		IT
		Client, insurers
	Slide 4: OK
		capabilities plural
	Slide 5: OK
	Slide 6: OK
		scale the IT?
	Slide 7: OK
		Simplify Management **of IT**
		**Business** critical software for only a small proportion of **clients' users**
		Software + **IT**/System => Software/System upgrade?
		**Client-side?**
	Slide 8: no brainer + ugly => to remove
	Section 9: OK but
		Ugly
		Question for the support of multiple cloud vendors, expecially present???
		Consistency future and present?
	Slide 10: OK
		Add other box around:
			what else they have: ResQ
			what else they would benefit from: Unify?
	Slide 12: not ok
		prefer slide 13
		if want to use:
			Shall we expand to MoSes (to show history and progression)?
			RAFM team edition introduction?
			Why RAEC adopts RAFM Gen-2 and GPU project not in clear?
			
	Slide 13
		Would recommend removing the red on the right bottom
	Slide 14-16 great
	Slide hidden 17-20: no ok
		agree not great, and more targetting RAF user
	Unify section:
		We are sure?
		Then need to be highlighted
	IFRS17:
		Too much business focused?
		Then remove business case?

Swedbank IFRS17
	IFRS 17 reporting already established, got RAFM, they just do not have engine, to make them aware as part of the discussion, as part of the PoC maybe.
	Any specific challenge from Finance reg getting financial understanding results
		Common issue with many clients
		Our solution can get out of the box with Unify
	Reached our to Peter after getting meeting
	Swedbank with Mårten
		Speculative: IFRS 17:
			they would require financial aalyst instead of accountant
			They do better and better, bust quite far 30 years
			More things on actuary
			Ask sit together
				Hire guy from KPMG
				Andre and him knows
			Not really big thing IFRS 17 for them
			Feel them independent
			IFRS 4 basis for budgetting and business plan, not sent to group
		Finance:
			2 BS: actuaries understand dynamic of how long BS is moving
			Big jump (change of assumptions):
			No one in finance understand IFRS 17 understand reg
			Mvt on BS on actuaries now
			Can restricit themselves on return UL
		Can reprice at any point of time => no ifrs 17
			Only theoretical because time consuming
			Not totally flexibility, restriction during 5 years following retirement.
			5 year of window at retirement: supposed that number of unit of underlying items paid to the PH but 100% sure
		Meeting with Unify Skandia
			Saw form Skandia perspective:
				MoSes Util
				Run it 10-15 hours
				Connect data
			Meeting WTW:
				How much gain
				How much extra effort
				Tinkie Winkie
					QRT aggregation tools that add external data
						Scalings
					Resistance against developping it to replace Excel by scripts
				Skandia does not use indata, but interested
				Karolis one week, not even 100%.
				More complex system dependency than
				Suitable for SII reporting used companies with 3 actuaries from insurance system out ot qrt reporting
				Peter summarised would be nice to have pitching that current solution

IFRS17 terminology
	VF - VIF - MOVESTIC ALONE
	PVFCF - BEL
	UI - FV
Movestic Variable mapping _old :
	schedule for following
		Obviously clean way would be to exclude from investment
		Otherwise where amendments done? Ovt, csv, RAFM output, RAFM code, RAFM data?
		Option 1: before OVT
			If investment contract cashflows, then not in actual cashflow (ok)
			Means that captures by a decrease to inv return which is balancing item (as charges are smaller)
			If not actual, should not be captured in expected to avoid variance, but similarly as reduction of inv return
				Option 1a; before RAFM output
					Modelling of absence of mort benefits feasible
						Flag in the code to specify whether override the mortality benefits in the data if type 1 and IFRS 17 run, and use alternative inv return per pol feasibel
						However derivation of corresponding Inv return to use per policy complex (would require two runs feeding each other for every steps, or at least some to reuse on other as approx)
						Also change on RFR to use complex as now per policy and per projection period
				Option 1b:
					On RAFM output
						Exact modelling
						Charges
							Need to move charges to inv return => why do not we do like for actuals?
						Replace cost mort > 0 by cost mort = revenue mort = 0
							Nice to have negative charges not offset by positive ones
						bi and bii: working with Philip: reconciliation against what done for Scildon. will work by def

				Strongly recommand
			Appoline cousin
				Had high potential child.
				Was struggling as needed a stimulant environment
				Happy that they found this school as could really provide the education at her level
				We think our won child is at least a bit (doing 300 piece puzzle, trinlingual, understand sarcasm, etc)
				Hence we want also our child to be pushed the same way.
		Conclusion
			Probably would not come to France if we are not accepted, not just not Lille
	Why came here
		Mention came only for school and work (ok) and see area
	Other
		Does she know about au pair situation in Lille
	Process
		Pre-Interview
			Decision on test
				WPPSI
					Let her bring the topic, only mention it if she does not.
					Mnetion could only find people giving it in Swedish in Sweden, and strictly refuse to translate any words to English if child was struggling
					Our child is trilingual, but it is fair to say he neverhtlees has lnaguage preferences.
					If absolutely nevessary we would fly to come do it, found someone in Paris
					Any suggestion of people who could do that?
			Any question / vote after seeing dossier?
			Any view based on early review of CV?
		Interview
			Want to go through assesment asap (to organise relocation)
				Bu first want to see and discuss
				Recommendation on preparation
			Confirm Lilea does not need present
			Confirm correct person being interviewing him (French and English speaker)
				Mr flower
		Rest of process:
			Time to feedback results?

			Hello
			Our 2-year-old daughter is experiencing a delay in her language development. Indeed, she is exposed to two languages, and we know that this can slow down progress. However, combining both languages, she knows about 10 words but hasn't formed any sentences yet.
			Do you have any speech therapists in Stockholm or nearby that you could recommend? The ideal criteria, listed by priority, although I understand that most might not be feasible:
				High-quality speech therapist (of course!)
				Appointments available relatively quickly (ideally without waiting for a long time, even if it means paying out of pocket, but I can't find anything like that)
				Able to evaluate French.
				Not too far from Kungsholmen.Certainly, these are many criteria, so if one or two can be met, that would already be fantastic!
			Thank you very much.

				vision of a “robo-banker” isn’t practical in
				2024. Financial documents and earnings reports
				contain graphs and tables with subtle footnotes
				that are very challenging for LLMs to interpret
				correctly. LLMs also have difficulty with the multi-
				step calculations needed to arrive at financial
				metrics that aren’t explicitly in the documents
				(e.g. ROIC or EBITDA)
			Problem in finance: tolerance for numerical mistake is 0
